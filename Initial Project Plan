Objective:
To analyze the data provided by Kenvue Inc. and develop a solution to optimize trade spend while identifying and promoting specific need states at the right times.

Team Structure:
The members of our group consist of Inshaal Butt, Tyra Chung, and Bryanah Gillis.

Initial division of work:
Data cleaning - Tyra (lead) + Inshaal
Data analysis - Bryanah (lead) + Inshaal + Tyra (we believe it's important for all of us to learn/be exposed to this part!)
Determining need state - Bryanah (lead) + Tyra
Data visualization - Inshaal (lead) + Tyra
Presentation slides - Inshaal (lead) + Bryanah

Approach:
1. Data Exploration:
Download the provided data from Kenvue Inc.
Perform initial exploratory data analysis to understand the structure, relationships, and potential patterns within the dataset.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing or inconsistent data to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
Normalize and standardize data for consistency in measurements.
Identify and handle outliers that may impact the analysis.

3. Data Analysis:
Utilize statistical analysis to identify trends and correlations between variables.
Group the need states and analyze their impact on Total Sales and POS Revenue.
Investigate the relationships between trade spend, need states, and sales.

4. Further Investigate 1 Need State
Use web-scraping to gather and compare competitor trends across that specific need state
Conduct an inventory turnover rate analysis
Determine what insights the trade spend reveals for that need state

5. Optimizing Trade Spend:
Develop algorithms or models to optimize trade spend based on historical data and identified patterns.
Consider machine learning techniques for predictive analysis, taking into account seasonal trends and customer behaviour.
Determine the most effective times to promote specific need states to maximize sales.

6. Client-Focused Recommendations:
Create actionable insights and recommendations for Kenvue Inc. based on the analysis.
Provide clear guidelines on when and how to promote specific need states.
Suggest adjustments to trade spend strategies to maximize ROI.

7. Go-to Market Strategy
Using the insights, our team will create a go-to market strategy that accompanies our findings from the questions.
The insights will be presented using Tableau and/or Powerpoint

Data Set:
The project will use the data provided by Kenvue Inc., including POS Factory $, Need State, Total Sales, DC Amount, Store Amt on Hand, and Total Trade Spend. This dataset will serve as the foundation for our analysis and optimization strategies.

External Data:
While the primary analysis will be based on the provided dataset, external market data will be considered to enrich the understanding of industry trends, competitive landscape, and consumer behaviour.

Technologies:
1. Programming Language: Python with its extensive data analysis libraries.
2. Data Analysis: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, NumPy for numerical operations.
3. Statistical Analysis: SciPy for statistical functions.
5. Visualization: Tableau and Powerpoint for creating visual representations of the data.
6. Collaboration: GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Documentation:
Documentation of the code and analysis process will be maintained to ensure transparency and replicability.

Presentation:
A final presentation will be prepared to communicate the findings, optimization strategies, and recommendations to the client.
