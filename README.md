**Goal:** Analyze the data provided by Kenvue Inc. and develop a solution to optimize trade spend while identifying and promoting specific need states at the right times.

**Initial Project Plan:** [Here](https://github.com/tchungg/MGTC28_Group_Project/blob/main/Initial%20Project%20Plan)

Below are links that connect to each notebook or csv file that has been uploaded to the main branch for better clarity of each stage in this project.


**Libraries/Technologies Used**

Technologies: Python, Tableau, Canva 

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib


**Data Sources** 

Kenvue provided a dataset that has been cleaned to correct any inconsistencies to prepare it for our analyses. 

[How We Cleaned the Data](https://github.com/tchungg/MGTC28_Group_Project/tree/main/Cleaning%20Data%20Set%20Notebooks) and [All Cleaned Files](https://github.com/tchungg/MGTC28_Group_Project/tree/main/Cleaned%20Data%20Sets)

**Seasonal Trends**
MISSING NOTEBOOK

To identify the seasonal trends, Factory POS and Total Inventory data were used to compare across all need states.

**Total Sales & Trade Spend**

Compared Need States 1-5

Based on the Total Sales and Trade Spend analysis, our group decided to further investigate **Need State 3** for the following reasons:

- Need state 3 has the lowest total sales

- Need state 3 has the lowest return on trade spend at 33.92%

- Need state 3 has the largest decrease in sales from 2022 - 2023 at a decline of $2.7M


To further analyze this need state, we have calculated the inventory turnover rate, and sales channel optimization & investigated the trade spend to gather insights.
