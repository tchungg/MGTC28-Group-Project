**Goal:** Analyze the data provided by Kenvue Inc. and develop a solution to optimize trade spend while identifying and promoting specific need states at the right times.

**Initial Project Plan:** https://github.com/tyrachung/MGTC28-Group-Project/blob/40485ec1c73dbfe57b6e4acf146f9e71e710bed0/Initial%20Project%20Plan

**Seasonal Trends**
MISSING NOTEBOOK

To identify the seasonal trends, Factory POS and Total Inventory data was used to compare across all need states.

                          Need State 3 Further Analyses


Based on the Total Sales and Trade Spend anaysis, our group decided to further investigate **Need State 3** for the folowing reasons:

- Need state 3 has the lowest total sales

- Need state 3 has the lowest return on trade spend at 33.92%

- Need state 3 has the largest decrease in sales from 2022 - 2023 at a decline of $2.7M


To further analyze this need state, we have calculated the inventory turnover rate, sales channel optimization & investigated the trade spend to gather insights.
